Expt1 Swing
Swing has about four times the number of User Interface [UI] components as AWT and is part of the standard Java distribution. By today’s application GUI requirements, AWT is a limited implementation, not quite capable of providing the components required for developing complex GUI’s required in modern commercial applications. The AWT component set has quite a few bugs and really does take up a lot of system resources when compared to equivalent Swing resources. Netscape introduced its Internet Foundation Classes [IFC] library for use with Java. Its Classes became very popular with programmers creating GUI’s for commercial applications.
