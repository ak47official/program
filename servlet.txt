Expt4 Servelt
Servlets are grouped under the Advanced Java tree that are used to create dynamic web applications. Servlets are robust in nature, well scalable and are primarily used in developing server-side applications. If we go a little back in time, we would be able to witness that before the introduction of servlets, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) were used. Amid several indigenous tasks that a servlet is capable of doing, dynamically performing client requests and responses are most common. Other tasks that a servlet can do effectively are:
•	Can easily manage/control the application flow.
•	Suitable to implement business logic.
•	Can effectively balance the load at the server-side.
•	Easily generate dynamic web content.
