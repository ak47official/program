problem Analysis:
In type casting program, we have three variables: 'i' which is an integer, 'I' which is a long and 'F' which is a Float.
We then assign value of 'i' variable which is an integer.
Then we pass this integer value to variable 'l' which is long, like long =i.
 Then  the same process we pass the value of 'l' which is long to variable 'F' which is Float, like Float F=l
After the passing this three value we will print this values.
over all, this program demonstrates how type casting works in java and how we can use it to convert data from one type to another.
