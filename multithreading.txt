problem Analysis:
In this program, we create s threads using the 'My Thread' class, which
extends the 'Thread' class.
Each thread executes a loop where it prints its name and a count From 1 to 3.
Between each count the thread sleeps For a random time between 0 and 1
second. 

To execute this program, simply run the 'main' method of the "multithread Analysis class 
This will create s threads that will execute concurrently printing their names and count to the console.
You can use this program as a starting point for multithreading program analysis and experimentation.
